# BotMan.py
A really small python bot for discord

If you can code in python, the code would be self explanatory, I guess

To get started, add your **bot prefix** and **your bot's token** in details.py. then add your bot using oath2 by checking these

**Scopes**: Bot

**Bot Permissions**: Administrator (this just gives all permissions to the bot. However, you can customize the permissions if you know what to do)

Or, if you want to try out the bot without the hassle of coding, you can just add my bot to your server with https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=845225811152732179&permissions=8&scope=bot
