# BotMan.py
A really small python bot for discord

If you can code in python, the code would be self explanatory, I guess

To get started, add your **bot prefix** and **your bot's token** in details.py. then add your bot using oath2 by checking these

**Scopes**: Bot

**Bot Permissions**: Administrator (this just gives all permissions to the bot. However, you can customize the permissions if you know what to do)
